## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained project focusing on a different machine learning task. Example projects include:
- **Spaceship Titanic**: Classification of passenger fate using feature engineering and advanced models.
- **Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset**: Predicting client responses to marketing using ensemble and neural models.
- **Regression with an Abalone Dataset**: Predicting age using regression and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset**: Rainfall event classification with pipelines and SVM.
- **Others**: AI Salary, Smoker Status Prediction, Podcast Listening Time, Introversion/Extroversion, Fertilizer Optimization, Titanic.

## üß† Methods & Approach

For each project, I followed a robust ML pipeline:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Missing value imputation: `SimpleImputer`, `KNNImputer`
  - Feature extraction & engineering: e.g. splitting cabin info, deriving new features
  - Encoding categorical features: `OneHotEncoder`, Label Encoding
  - Scaling: `StandardScaler`
  - Pipeline structuring: `Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`
- **Model Building**  
  - Regression: `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `MLPRegressor`
  - Classification: `LogisticRegression`, `MLPClassifier`, `RandomForest`, `XGBClassifier`, `SVC`, `NaiveBayes`
  - Hyperparameter tuning: `GridSearchCV`, `RandomizedSearchCV`
- **Evaluation**  
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, RMSE, R¬≤
  - Cross-validation
- **Submission & Deployment**  
  - Automated CSV generation for Kaggle submissions
