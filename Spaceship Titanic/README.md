## 🛰️ Spaceship Titanic - Classification Challenge

Welcome to the **Spaceship Titanic** classification project! This repository contains the full pipeline for tackling the [Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/), where the objective is to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during a cosmic disaster.

### 📊 Competition Overview

* **Task**: Binary classification (`Transported` - `True`/`False`)
* **Input**: Demographic, location, and spending information
* **Output**: Whether the passenger was transported

> Each row represents one passenger.

---

### 🔍 Features

Key columns in `train.csv`:

* `PassengerId`: Unique ID (e.g., `0001_01`)
* `HomePlanet`: Earth, Europa, or Mars
* `CryoSleep`: Whether the passenger was asleep during the trip
* `Cabin`: Deck/num/side (e.g., `B/0/P`)
* `Destination`: Destination planet
* `Age`: Age in years
* `RoomService`, `FoodCourt`, `ShoppingMall`, `Spa`, `VRDeck`: Spending data
* `Name`: Passenger name
* `Transported`: **Target column**

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) and place the CSVs in `data/`.
2. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Spaceship_Titanic_Classifier.ipynb
```

3. Follow the notebook to explore:

   * Data cleaning
   * Feature engineering
   * Model training & evaluation
   * Submission generation

---

### ✅ Output

* The notebook generates:

  * A trained classifier
  * Feature importance plots
  * A `submission.csv` for Kaggle upload

---

### 📈 Scoring Metric

* **Accuracy**: Fraction of correct predictions on the test set.
* Submission file must match the format of `sample_submission.csv`.

---

### 🧠 Notable Engineering Steps

* Extract `Deck`, `Num`, and `Side` from `Cabin`
* Impute missing values using `SimpleImputer` or `KNNImputer`
* Encode categorical features with `OneHotEncoder`
* Use `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` for clean preprocessing

---

### 🧪 Model Options

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost / LightGBM
* StackingClassifier for ensemble learning

---

### 📤 Submission

Generate and save your prediction as:

```python
submission.to_csv("submission.csv", index=False)
```

Upload it to the Kaggle competition page.
